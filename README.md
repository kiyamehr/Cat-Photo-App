🐱 Cat Photo App

I’m learning frontend development and this is one of the first projects I built.
It’s a really simple Cat Photo App from the FreeCodeCamp HTML course.

Nothing crazy, just practicing the basics like:

- writing HTML

- adding images

- using lists and links

- simple form tags

I’m just getting started, so I’ll upload more small projects as I learn more.
This is basically the beginning of my frontend journey.
